GridFTP in UNICORE 6
SDI Integration Test

1. Prerequisites

* Java 6 JRE is installed and java command on the PATH

* Globus Toolkit version 5.0.5 is installed, myproxy-logon on the PATH

* The UNICORE commandline client version 6.5.0 is installed and the
  ucc command on the PATH


2.  How to use this package:

* Update site.conf for your local environment and the resources you're
  testing with:
  a) Set XSEDE_USER_NAME to your XSEDE user name.
  b) Set UCC_KEYSTORE_PW to the password you would like to protect your keystore
     with. The keystore will hold a short-lived credential (X.509 certificate)
     that the client uses to act on your behalf on the Grid.
  c) Set GFTP_STAGEOUT_HOST to any one of the candidate host names commented
     in the site.conf file. The candidate hosts are GridFTP services deployed 
     by XSEDE partners.

* ./prep
  This generates a number of JSDL documents based on the settings in
  site.conf.

* ./test-ucc
  This runs all the automated UNICORE ucc tests.

* ./clean
  This cleans up files generated by the tests.  If you make changes to
  site.conf, you should do "./clean ; ./prep" before rerunning any tests.
  
3. Notes

* It is possible to run parts of the test suite separately by providing test
  names or patterns as an argument, e.g. ./test-ucc "Functionality 2$" will run
  the second functionality test. The "$" sign acts as a delimiter, so as not to
  run the test "Functionality 20" (if it existed). Executing 
  ./test-ucc "Functionality" will run all functionality tests, executing
  ./test-ucc "Performance" starts all performance tests, and so on.
  Running performance tests 8 and 9 works using regular expressions like this:
  ./test-ucc "Performance 8|9$".
  Running performance tests 1 to 8 works using regular expressions like this:
  ./test-ucc "Performance [1-8]$".
